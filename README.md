# SOLID Principles

Project about learning the five Principles of the SOLID 


### S - Single Responsability Principle
#### *Every software component should have one and only one responsibility
#### [Live code example](https://github.com/antonio-dias/solid-principles/tree/master/1%20-%20Single%20Responsability%20Principle/live_example)

> ### Cohesion
> Cohesion is the degree to which the various parts of a software component are related
> 
> Higher cohesion helps attain better adherence to the Single Responsability Principle
>> [example](https://github.com/antonio-dias/solid-principles/tree/master/1%20-%20Single%20Responsability%20Principle/cohesion) 
>
> ### Coupling
> Coupling is defined as the level of inter dependency between various software components
> 
> Loose Coupling helps attain better adherence to the Single Responsability Principle
